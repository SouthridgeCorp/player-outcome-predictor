    - The management team of Sportiqo can use this application to:
        - Evaluate whether the application produces `reliable_simulations` of historical T20 tournaments
        - Configure an `upcoming_tournament` and use the application to produce a `reliable_simulation` for the tournament
        - Review the `projected_sportiqo_rewards_by_player_across_scenarios` to set the base price for player counter auctions
    - FDm Collaborators working on this project can use this application to:
        - Iterate on modeling choices to improve the performnce of the `inferential_model` and the 
        `predictive_simulation_models`
