# Working Backwards

The working backwards document is like the output layer of
a neural network. It defines the goals that the computational
model of your product should work towards.

By insisting that this be the first document you create, you
are able to effectively work backwards from the desired end state to
conceptualizing all required inputs as well as specs for intermediary processes.
