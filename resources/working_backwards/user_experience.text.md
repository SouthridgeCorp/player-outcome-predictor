- `mean_absolute_error`
- `mean_absolute_percentage_error`

## Review Inferential Models Tab:

- `batting_team_id` (one-hot encoded)
- `bowling_team_id` (one-hot encoded)
- `over_number` (one-hot encoded)

granularities:
    - `by_player_and_innnings`
    - `by_player_and_match`
    - `by_player_and_tournament_stage`
    - `by_player_and_tournament`
- Lets the user view the projected `top_k` best performing players in each team as measured by `evaluation_metrics.rewards_by_player`:
    - `top_k_players_by_team_and_tournament`
    - `top_k_batsmen_by_team_and_tournament`
    - `top_k_bowlers_by_team_and_tournament`

### Definitions:

#### `predictive_simulation_model`

A model that generates a set of `credible_scenarios` by using the `inferential_models` to simulate entire tournaments
by building them from ball by ball outcomes. Each `credible_scenario` will be associated with a set of `simulation_evaluation_metrics`.

## Simulate Tournament Tab:

### Objective:
- Lets the user configure an `upcoming_tournament` and use the `predictive_simulation_model` to produce a 
`reliable_simulation` for the tournament.
- Lets the user review the `rewards_by_player_and_tournament` for the `focus_players` and perform
basic sensitivity analysis on the `rewards_formula_calculation_parameters`
- To be used for discussion on design of the `reward_fairness_metric`. Once designed, it will also be shown here. 

### Definitions:
- An `upcoming_tournament` is composed of:
    - `playing_teams`
    - `playing_xi_by_team_key`
    - `tournament_format`: Current version will only implement round robin league with eliminator based playoffs.
    - `focus_players`: 5 players per team for whom player counters are to be auctioned.
